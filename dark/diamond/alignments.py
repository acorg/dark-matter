    Hold information about a set of DIAMOND records.

    @param reads: A L{dark.reads.Reads} instance providing the sequences that
        were given to DIAMOND as queries. Note that the order of the reads
        *MUST* match the order of the records in the DIAMOND output files.
    @param filenames: Either a single C{str} filename or a C{list} of C{str}
        file names containing our (possibly bzip2 compressed) per-line JSON
        produced by C{bin/convert-diamond-to-json.py} from DIAMOND tabular
        (outfmt 6) output.
    @param databaseFilename: A C{str} holding the name of the FASTA file used
        to make the DIAMOND database. Cannot be used with
        C{sqliteDatabaseFilename}.
    @param databaseDirectory: The directory where the FASTA file
        used to make the DIAMOND database can be found. This argument is only
        useful when sqliteDatabaseFilename is specified.

        database file made from the FASTA used to make the DIAMOND database
        (Use ../../bin/make-fasta-database.py to construct such a database).
        Cannot be used with C{databaseFilename}.
    @param scoreClass: A class to hold and compare scores (see scores.py).
        Default is C{HigherIsBetterScore}, for comparing bit scores. If you
        are using e-values, pass LowerIsBetterScore instead.
    @param sortFilenames: A C{bool}. If C{True}, C{filenames} will be
        sorted by numeric prefix (using L{numericallySortFilenames}) before
        being read. This can be used to conveniently sort the files produced
        by our HTCondor jobs.
    @param randomizeZeroEValues: If C{True}, e-values that are zero will be set
        to a random (very good) value.
    @raises ValueError: if a file type is not recognized, or if the number of
        reads does not match the number of records found in the DIAMOND result
        files, or if neither (or both) of databaseFilename and
        sqliteDatabaseFilename are given.
