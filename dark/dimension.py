def dimensionalIterator(dimensions, maxItems=-1):
    """
    Given a list of n positive integers, return a generator that yields
    n-tuples of coordinates to 'fill' the dimensions. This is like an
    odometer in a car, but the dimensions do not each have to be 10.

    For example: dimensionalIterator((2, 3)) will yield in order
    (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2). See the tests in
    test_dimension.py for many more examples.

    A dimension may also be given as '*', to provide a dimension that is
    never exhausted. For example, dimensionalIterator(('*', 2)) yields the
    infinite series (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), ....

    maxItems can be used to limit the number of tuples yielded.
