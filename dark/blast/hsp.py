    """
    Examine the sense of an HSP and return information about where the
    read and the alignment (match) begin and end.  Return a dict with keys
    that allow the read and the alignment to be displayed relative to the
    hit orientation (i.e., with start < stop for both the read and the
    match). The returned read indices are offsets into the hit. I.e.,
    they indicate where on the hit the read lies.

    In the returned object, all indices are suitable for Python string
    slicing etc.  We must be careful to convert from the 1-based offsets
    found in BLAST output properly.

    hsp['frame'] is a (read, hit) 2-tuple, with both values coming from
    {-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3}. The sign indicates negative or positive sense
    (i.e., the direction of reading through the read or hit to get the
    alignment). The value is the nucleotide match offset modulo 3, plus one
    (i.e., it tells us which of the 3 possible reading frames is used in
    the match). The value is redundant because that information could also
    be obtained from the mod 3 value of the match offset.

    NOTE: the returned readStartInSubject value may be negative.  We consider
    the hit sequence to start at offset 0.  So if the read string has
    sufficient additional nucleotides before the start of the alignment
    match, it may protrude to the left of the hit. Similarly, the returned
    readEndInSubject can be greater than the subjectEnd.
