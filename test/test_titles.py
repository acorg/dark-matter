# Note: Tests for the TitlesAlignments class are in blast/test_titles.py
#       and diamond/test_titles.py because that class needs a concrete
#       (iterable) dark.alignments.ReadsAlignments class passed to its
#       __init__.  The tests below test the simpler dark.titles classes,
#       TitleAlignment and TitleAlignments.
