    @param minimizeGaps: Post-process the edlib output to remove unnecessary gaps.
    @param onlyTwoSequences: Ensure that C{reads} only has two reads.
    @param matchAmbiguous: If C{True}, count ambiguous nucleotides that are
        possibly correct as actually being correct. Otherwise, we are strict
        and nucleotide codes only match themselves.
    @param canonicalizeGaps: Post-process the edlib output so that nucleotides
        that could have been at the end of a gap (instead of in the middle of
        a gap, thereby creating two gaps) are moved to the gap end. This results
        in unecessary gaps being merged.

        For example, in this alignment:

            ACTCTGACGTC
            ACT--G---TC

        the G in the second row could equivalently have been placed at the end of
        a single gap:

            ACTCTGACGTC
            ACT-----GTC

        The single gap is more akin to what MAFFT does because it is reluctant to
        open a new gap. edlib doesn't work in that way, it greedily aligns whatever
        it can as it works its way through the two sequences.

        Here's an example where gaps aren't merged but matching nucleotides are
        moved to the end of the gap. This:

            ACTCGACGTC
            ACTCG---TC

        becomes this:

            ACTCGACGTC

            A-----G----AT-C-T-----G-T-----------T--C--TCT-----A-A----------A--CGAAC
